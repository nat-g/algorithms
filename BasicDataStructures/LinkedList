#Singly Linked Lists

A linked list is a low-level data structure. It stores an ordered sequence of items in individual "node" objects 
that have pointers to other nodes.

In a singly-linked list, the nodes each have one pointer to the next node.

The node is where data is stored in the linked list.
In a linked list, the first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail.

My simple implementation of a linked list includes the following methods:
IsEmpty: checks if the liked list is empty
Add: inserts a new node into the list
Size: returns size of list
Search: searches list for a node containing the requested data and returns that node if found, otherwise raises an error
Remove: searches list for a node containing the requested data and removes it from list if found, otherwise raises an error
